### Code Reuse Review

- Don't put everything in `main()`
- Try hard to *separate* code by `logic chunk`.
- Why we store `attributes` in a `Class`?
   - Because they can be shared across different functions inside that class that we don't need to pass parameters to function inside the `class`

- Try to understand the essence of `private`?
    - Encapsulate as much as possible
    - Try to understand why attributes are `private`?
    - Try to understand why some functions are also`private`?
